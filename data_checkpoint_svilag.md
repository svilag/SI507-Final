Each link in the above list contains about 30-40 links to pages with score data, and about 30-40 links to detailed recap pages.

The scores pages include a table with performance scores for each group, divided by group class level (example score page: [https://wgi.org/wp-content/uploads/wgi_events/static_scores/2022/scores_San_Bernardino_Perc_Finals.html](https://wgi.org/wp-content/uploads/wgi_events/static_scores/2022/scores_San_Bernardino_Perc_Finals.html)).

The recap pages contain similar data, but in a more complex table with breakdowns by category with the names of judges for each category listed. Theses scores are also divided by group class level (example recaps page: [https://recaps.competitionsuite.com/24c4c8ec-a300-4737-816b-e78dc0a3221c.htm](https://recaps.competitionsuite.com/24c4c8ec-a300-4737-816b-e78dc0a3221c.htm)).
